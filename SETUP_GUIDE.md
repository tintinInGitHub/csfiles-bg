   npm install
   npm start
   ```
   The server will run on `http://localhost:4000`

2. **Open the Game**
   - Open `index.html` in your web browser
   - Or serve files: `python -m http.server 8000` then go to `http://localhost:8000`

3. **Create a Room**
   - Enter your name
   - Choose number of players (4-12)
   - Click "Create Room"
   - You'll get a room code (e.g., "1001")

4. **Share the Room Code**
   - Tell other players the room code
   - They need to join using this code

### For Other Players (Joining):

1. **Open the Game**
   - Open `index.html` in your web browser
   - Or go to the same URL as the host

2. **Join the Room**
   - Enter your name
   - Enter the room code from the host
   - Click "Join Room"

   ifconfig
   ```

   - Edit `game-server.js`
   - Change line 3: `constructor(serverUrl = 'ws://YOUR_IP:4000')`
   - Replace `YOUR_IP` with the host's IP address

3. **Share Files**
   - Host shares the game files with other players
   - Or host serves files: `python -m http.server 8000`
   - Players go to `http://HOST_IP:8000`

### Internet Play (Different Locations):

1. **Deploy Server**
